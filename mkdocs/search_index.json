You write to recruiter, recruiter writes to you, you write to the\nperson who recommended you. You get an offer and you start writing emails to\nrelocation agency that gets you a visa.\n\n\nThe long-term visa is the biggest time waster, which can be even noticed in the\nflow of emails. The gap in November was a period, when we had all papers ready\nand we waited for government approval of my hiring.\n\n\nSomewhat later there is another flow of emails when I started searching for a\nflat and I exchanged emails with the reality agents.\n\n\nThe third surge of emails is when I found that I cannot get the short term visa\non time and I had to notify everyone about the change of my start date.\n\n\nIn the end, I wrote an email of resignation at my current work place (one small\nemail, a giant leap in terms of your geographic coordinates). Then I packed my\nstuff for real, and 5 month from start, here I am at Red Hat office in Brno,\nCzech Republic.\n\n\nHow did all that start\n\n\nThat was by accident, of course. The story of me relocating to Brno started in\nSeptember 2016, when one evening I sat at computer screen, as usual, lazily\nscrolling \nhttps://dirty.ru\n. And then among the gifs with\nfunny kittens I found a job posting from a Red hatter. It was a short one\ntelling something like \n'It's Red Hat calling, c'mon send me your CVs'\n.  I\nwanted to give it a try and I sent mine. Which, as I understand now, was the\neasiest part of all.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to\n\n\n\n\nEmail statistics in this article is collected with a little help of \nIMAP SEARCH\n\n[1]\n\n\nListening to \nthis brilliantly cynical version\n [4]\n of 'With a Little Help From\nMy Friends\" also helped a lot.\n\n\n[4], in turn, makes fun on usage of [5]\n\n\nOne more thing: if you liked [4], you'll also like [6]\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\n\n\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501#section-6.4.4\n\n\nhttps://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en\n\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/imaplib.html\n\n\nWhat Would You Think If I Sang Autotune?\n\n\nAuto-Tune\n\n\nR.E.M. - \"Losing My Religion\" In Major Key",

You write to recruiter, recruiter writes to you, you write to the\nperson who recommended you. You get an offer and you start writing emails to\nrelocation agency that gets you a visa.  The long-term visa is the biggest time waster, which can be even noticed in the\nflow of emails. The gap in November was a period, when we had all papers ready\nand we waited for government approval of my hiring.  Somewhat later there is another flow of emails when I started searching for a\nflat and I exchanged emails with the reality agents.  The third surge of emails is when I found that I cannot get the short term visa\non time and I had to notify everyone about the change of my start date.  In the end, I wrote an email of resignation at my current work place (one small\nemail, a giant leap in terms of your geographic coordinates). Then I packed my\nstuff for real, and 5 month from start, here I am at Red Hat office in Brno,\nCzech Republic.",
